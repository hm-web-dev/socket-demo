# socket-demo

This is a socket demo that was started using `npm init vue`. 

Then Chat-GPT wrote server.js and some Vue code that I organized into `App.vue`.  Pretty neat if you ask me! 

TODO: 
- Allow people to change their name when joining. 
- Do not allow people to join a room when the game is going. 
- Allow to create rooms in a database
